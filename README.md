# I Can't Fucking Decide Between

"I Can't Fucking Decide" is a simple and effective app designed by [Just Miss Alex](https://twitter.com/JustMissAlex) to help you make decisions when you're feeling stuck or overwhelmed by choices. Whether you're deciding what to eat, what movie to watch, or where to go, this app will randomly pick an option for you, so you don't have to.

## Notes

For compile the min css version, you can use:

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./assets/css/styles.css -o ./assets/css/styles.min.css --watch --minify
```

## Credits

This app is a recreation of the original **"I Can't Fucking Decide"** created by **JustMissAlex**. Unfortunately, the original application is no longer functioning, so I took the initiative to rebuild the same page to preserve its simple yet useful concept.

All credit for the original idea and design goes to **JustMissAlex**. This project is a tribute to their work, and my recreation stays as faithful as possible to the original experience.
